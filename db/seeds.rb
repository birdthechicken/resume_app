# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# student_1 = Student.create(first_name: "Alexandria", last_name: "Erb")
# student_2 = Student.create(first_name: "Sinan", last_name: "Gundogar")

# student_3 = Student.create(first_name: "Abraham", last_name: "Kim")
# student_4 = Student.create(first_name: "Jeff", last_name: "Brinker")

# student_5 = Student.create(first_name: "Sabrina", last_name: "DiMichele")
# student_6 = Student.create(first_name: "Chris", last_name: "Bowen")
